# Battery Status
Displays the current power level of the battery in Atom's status bar, and
indicates if the battery is currently charging. Especially useful if you often
work in full-screen mode on your laptop!

## Known issues
The backend only supports linux and osx (darwin) at the moment, drop a feature
request at [node-power-info](https://github.com/cmd-johnson/node-power-info) to
get yours added, or (even better), if you already have a solution in mind, feel
free to contribute and make a pull request!
If you'd like to have some configuration options, just drop a feature request
here and I'll look into it.
