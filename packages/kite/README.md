Kite for Atom
=============

Kite gives you completions and documentation in Atom, sorted by popularity.

We'll be adding many more features very soon.

You can learn more about the broader Kite product at <http://kite.com>.  As part of this package, you also get the Kite Sidebar, which shows more information as you're working.  You can access the Kite Sidebar by launching Kite in your Applications folder.
