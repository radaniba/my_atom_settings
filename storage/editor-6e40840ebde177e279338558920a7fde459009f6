If more\\n  than one selection is active, uses the most recent one.\\n\\n- **Gist Open Buffers** Creates a gist with the content of all buffers in the active\\n  workspace\\n\\n## Using Your GitHub Account\\n\\nGist It will post gists anonymously by default, to post to your own GitHub\\naccount [generate a new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the\\n`gists` scope and copy it into the package's preferences (see the section below\\nif you have trouble finding these).\\n\\nIf you keep your Atom configuration in a public repo, or otherwise don't want\\nyour token to reside in the main user config, you can instead put it in\\n`~/.atom/gist-it.token`. You can then add this file to a `.gitignore` file to\\nkeep it out of public repos.\\n\\n## Preferences\\n\\nTo configure your preferences for Gist It, open the Atom preferences with\\n<kbd>⌘,</kbd> and select 'Gist It' from the sidebar. From there\\nyou can modify a variety of settings:\\n\\n- **New Gists Default To Private (Boolean)** By default, new gists will be\\n  _public_. you can change this option manually when creating the gist, or\\n  set it to instead default to _private_ by enabling this option.\\n\\n- **User Token (String)** This field allows the user to enter a custom generated\\n  OAuth token to have Gists attributed to their GitHub account. A token can be\\n  created [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) and must include the\\n  `gist` scope.\\n\",\n  \"readmeFilename\": \"README.md\",\n  \"bugs\": {\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/rpowelll/gist-it/issues\"\n  },\n  \"homepage\": \"https://github.com/rpowelll/gist-it\",\n  \"_id\": \"gist-it@0.4.0\",\n  \"dist\": {\n    \"shasum\": \"e5c4ceb51c2de816a7f706ea17503a73a51fe980\"\n  },\n  \"_resolved\": \"/var/folders/38/c32tn82s0238c61_q5nw37h40000gn/T/d-114317-70235-1tilwbl/package.tgz\",\n  \"_from\": \"/var/folders/38/c32tn82s0238c61_q5nw37h40000gn/T/d-114317-70235-1tilwbl/package.tgz\"\n}\n","markers":{"markers":{"1":{"id":1,"range":[[0,0],[0,0]],"tailed":false,"reversed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"never","persistent":true,"properties":{"type":"selection","editorId":21,"preserveFolds":true,"goalBufferRange":null},"deserializer":"Marker"}},"deserializer":"MarkerManager"},"history":{"undoStack":[],"redoStack":[],"deserializer":"History"},"filePath":"/Users/Rad/.atom/packages/gist-it/package.json","modifiedWhenLastPersisted":false,"digestWhenLastPersisted":"da2890065c84f784b324edfe8d9da579df6f666a","deserializer":"TextBuffer"}],"deserializer":"Project"},"workspace":{"paneContainer":{"root":{"items":[{"id":21,"softTabs":true,"scrollTop":0,"scrollLeft":0,"displayBuffer":{"id":22,"softWrap":false,"editorWidthInChars":149,"tokenizedBuffer":{"bufferPath":"/Users/Rad/.atom/packages/gist-it/package.json","tabLength":2,"deserializer":"TokenizedBuffer"},"deserializer":"DisplayBuffer"},"deserializer":"Editor"}],"activeItemUri":"/Users/Rad/.atom/packages/gist-it/package.json","focused":false,"active":true,"deserializer":"Pane"},"deserializer":"PaneContainer"},"fullScreen":false,"deserializer":"Workspace"},"packageStates":{"script":{"scriptOptionsViewState":""},"fuzzy-finder":{"/Users/Rad/.atom/packages/gist-it/package.json":1397783115853},"keybinding-resolver":{"attached":false},"metrics":{"sessionLength":100798},"tree-view":{"directoryExpansionStates":{},"selectedPath":"/Users/Rad/.atom/packages/gist-it/keymaps","hasFocus":false,"attached":true,"scrollLeft":0,"scrollTop":0,"width":200}}}
