It doesn't have to be labeled as a data science book as it can touch one of its many disciplines, that can vary from Math to Statics and from Programming to Design.\n\nIn this short review, I am going to cover different points that can help you in choosing the right data science book that fits your need. Our needs keep changing with time so by looking at your library either on your bookshelf or in your electronic device you will notice the evolution of your interests and it will feels like you're looking at an old picture of yourself, it may even bring a little smile on your face. If you feel this at some point, that's a good sign, it means you're evolving for the best as a person.\n\nIt is not that hard to find a book nowadays for anything you want. Whatever you want to learn, there is someone, somewhere in the world, who got that covered in a book, a chapter of a book, may be few lines ...\n\nSo the important thing here, is to make a good decision as to pick a specific book or not, because it can be a waste of time to pick the wrong/bad one, financially and also time wise.\n\nSometimes the outline is exactly what you hope for, you dig deep into details and you realize that the author just scratched the surface and you leave the pages with your desire to learn something not really fulfilled as you were just reading things you knew already.\n\nThis is a very quick checklist that will help you choose an interesting book, or at least prioritize properly.\n\n- **Check the author's bio** : It can help to know the author(s), knowing the background of who wrote the book, his research and main interests, is already an indication of the details level in the book. But, new authors deserve a chance too, don't make this point crucial.\n- **Read the introduction carefully** : Most of the books online display the introduction for free. Don't hesitate to download a preview and read the introductory pages carefully. Most of the time, authors describe not only the context in which the book was written but also the details of the different chapters.\n- **Favor books with independent chapters** : This is a personal preference, a technical book is not a fiction or a romance. Although it is important to learn gradually from a book, from the simpler aspects to the more complicated ones, choosing a book with more or less independent chapters will give you freedom on the structure you want to have to learn something, a book outline is the author's personal perspective which is certainly helpful, but it was designed at a specific mindset that is not necessarily yours so you might keep some distance between the way you want to learn something and what others think.\n- **Do you have a bookstore close by ?** : Although you can find everything online nowadays, going at a bookstore will give you the chance to physically get in contact with what you need. Sometimes It happens that I just change my mind and get another book, when I browse rapidly some key chapters of interests and get the feeling that it is not what I actually need.\n- **Read online reviews** : and don't trust all of them, remember that reviews are subjective, but the online reviews will give you a general opinion of what people think of the book you want to get, and as we say : don't judge a book by its cover :) I usually trust Amazon's reviews, people leave insightful comments and criticisms to the authors and usually raise valid points that are worth taking in consideration.\n\n\n# Books of interest\n\nThere are tons of great books in data science, in this review I am listing some of the most important ones, in my opinion. Please do add a comment with a reference to a book not covered in this post and that you think it is worth adding to the list.\n\nHere is a list of the books I've read and that I really like (order doesn't mean anything) :\n\n<div align=\"center\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n| | Book Title | Author(s)     |\n|:--- |:------------- | :------------- |\n| <img src=\"https://columbiadatascience.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/screen-shot-2013-10-13-at-8-43-15-pm.png\"  width=\"100\"> | Doing Data Science      | Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt      |\n| <img src=\"http://images.pearsoned-ema.com/jpeg/large/9781633430235.jpg\"  width=\"100\"> | Docker in Action      | Jeff Nickoloff    |\n| <img src=\"http://freecomputerbooks.com/covers/The-Art-of-R-Programming-Matloff-Norman.jpg\"  width=\"100\"> | The Art Of R Programming      | Norman Matloff       |\n| <img src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41naOY0eduL._SX397_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\"  width=\"100\"> | Introducing Data Science      | Davy Cielen and Arno Meysman       |\n| <img src=\"https://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/3261OS_1782_Learning%20Predictive%20Analytics%20with%20Python.jpg\"  width=\"100\"> | Learning Predictive Analytics with Python   | Ashish Kumar      |\n| <img src=\"http://it-ebooks.info/images/ebooks/9/data_structures_and_algorithms_in_python.jpg\"  width=\"100\"> | Data Structures and Algorithms in Python     | Michael T.

The reason I am bringing on all these books together in a single post is that I think there is some sort of overlapping in the concepts and theories,  the interesting point is that they are discussed and treated differently. I decided to pick some features to frame the discussion about these books, as the main topic of this post is how to choose a good and useful data science book. below is a detailed review with points discussed regarding the form and the content and hopefully you will find these useful in prioritizing your next acquisition. Also remember, **you will never get enough from a single book**, data science field is very complicated and cannot be contained in a single book.\n\n## Length (number of pages)\n\n\n\n## Writing Style\n\n## Structure\n\n## Content\n\n### Judging the book by its cover ?\n\n### Depth of explanation\n\n### Code Explanation\n\n### Complexity Level\n\n### Code Repositories\n\n# Conclusion : this review in d3js\n","defaultMarkerLayerId":"0","markerLayers":{"0":{"id":"0","maintainHistory":false,"markersById":{},"version":2},"1":{"id":"1","maintainHistory":false,"markersById":{},"version":2},"2":{"id":"2","maintainHistory":true,"markersById":{"1":{"range":{"start":{"row":0,"column":0},"end":{"row":0,"column":0}},"properties":{"type":"selection","preserveFolds":true},"reversed":false,"tailed":false,"valid":true,"invalidate":"never"}},"version":2},"5":{"id":"5","maintainHistory":false,"markersById":{},"version":2},"7":{"id":"7","maintainHistory":false,"markersById":{},"version":2},"8":{"id":"8","maintainHistory":false,"markersById":{},"version":2},"12":{"id":"12","maintainHistory":false,"markersById":{},"version":2}},"nextMarkerLayerId":13,"history":{"version":3,"nextCheckpointId":1,"undoStack":[],"redoStack":[]},"encoding":"utf8","filePath":"/Users/Rad/Documents/Dev/radaniba.github.io/_drafts/2016-03-20-what-i-think-of-these-20-data-science-books.markdown","digestWhenLastPersisted":"8cb915aba685c424a2a468ce5e5bf69e7cf7e249","preferredLineEnding":null,"nextMarkerId":288,"deserializer":"TextBuffer","version":5}]},"workspace":{"deserializer":"Workspace","paneContainer":{"deserializer":"PaneContainer","version":1,"root":{"deserializer":"Pane","id":3,"items":[{"deserializer":"TextEditor","id":28,"softTabs":false,"firstVisibleScreenRow":96,"firstVisibleScreenColumn":0,"displayBuffer":{"deserializer":"DisplayBuffer","id":29,"softWrapped":true,"tokenizedBuffer":{"deserializer":"TokenizedBuffer","bufferPath":"/Users/Rad/Documents/Dev/radaniba.github.io/_drafts/2016-03-20-what-i-think-of-these-20-data-science-books.markdown","bufferId":"7f267275883b287b823a6433d4b49969","tabLength":null,"largeFileMode":false},"largeFileMode":false,"foldsMarkerLayerId":"1"},"selectionsMarkerLayerId":"2"}],"activeItemURI":"/Users/Rad/Documents/Dev/radaniba.github.io/_drafts/2016-03-20-what-i-think-of-these-20-data-science-books.markdown","focused":true,"flexScale":1},"activePaneId":3},"packagesWithActiveGrammars":["language-gfm","language-yaml","language-hyperlink","language-todo"],"destroyedItemURIs":["atom://config/updates"]},"packageStates":{"linter":{"scope":"File"},"pigments":{"project":{"deserializer":"ColorProject","timestamp":"2016-06-17T03:10:53.824Z","version":"1.0.1","markersVersion":"1.0.7","globalSourceNames":["**/*.styl","**/*.stylus","**/*.less","**/*.sass","**/*.scss"],"globalIgnoredNames":["vendor/*","node_modules/*","spec/*","test/*"],"buffers":{"28":{"id":28,"path":"/Users/Rad/Documents/Dev/radaniba.github.io/_drafts/2016-03-20-what-i-think-of-these-20-data-science-books.markdown","colorMarkers":[]}},"paths":[],"variables":{"deserializer":"VariablesCollection","content":[]}}},"fuzzy-finder":{"/Users/Rad/Documents/Dev/radaniba.github.io/_drafts/2016-03-20-what-i-think-of-these-20-data-science-books.markdown":1466129686938},"metrics":{"sessionLength":3366919},"tree-view":{"directoryExpansionStates":{"/Users/Rad/Documents/Dev/radaniba.github.io":{"isExpanded":true,"entries":{"_data":{"isExpanded":false,"entries":{}},"_drafts":{"isExpanded":true,"entries":{}},"_includes":{"isExpanded":false,"entries":{}},"_layouts":{"isExpanded":false,"entries":{}},"_plugins":{"isExpanded":false,"entries":{}},"_posts":{"isExpanded":false,"entries":{}},"blog":{"isExpanded":false,"entries":{}},"css":{"isExpanded":false,"entries":{}},"img":{"isExpanded":false,"entries":{}},"js":{"isExpanded":false,"entries":{}}}}},"selectedPath":"/Users/Rad/Documents/Dev/radaniba.github.io/_drafts/2016-03-20-what-i-think-of-these-20-data-science-books.markdown","hasFocus":false,"attached":true,"scrollLeft":0,"scrollTop":0,"width":200}},"fullScreen":false}
