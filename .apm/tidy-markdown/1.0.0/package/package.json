Based on the conventions in [Carrot Creative's Markdown Styleguide](https://github.com/carrot/markdown-styleguide) and built on [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked).\n\nThere is also an [Atom Plugin](https://atom.io/packages/tidy-markdown) to run this entirely within your editor.\n\n## Install\n\nTidy Markdown is an [npm](http://npmjs.org/package/tidy-markdown) package, so it can be installed like this:\n\n```bash\nnpm install tidy-markdown -g\n```\n\n## CLI\n\nTidy Markdown includes a simple CLI. It operates entirely over STDIN/STDOUT. For example:\n\n```bash\n$ echo \"# a header #\" | tidy-markdown\n# a header\n```\n\nOr using a file:\n\n```bash\n$ tidy-markdown < ./ugly-markdown\n# Some markdown\n\nLorem ipsum dolor adipiscing\n\n- one\n- two\n- three\n```\n\nAnd, of course, we can output to a file too:\n\n```bash\n$ tidy-markdown < ./ugly-markdown > ./clean-markdown\n```\n\nThe `--help` arg will make it show a usage page:\n\n```\nusage: tidy-markdown [-h] [-v] [--no-ensure-first-header-is-h1]\n\nfix ugly markdown.\n\nOptional arguments:\n  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.\n  -v, --version         Show program's version number and exit.\n  --no-ensure-first-header-is-h1\n                        Disable fixing the first header when it isn't an H1.\n                        This is useful if the markdown you're processing\n                        isn't a full document, but rather a piece of a larger\n                        document.\n```\n\n## API\n\nTidy Markdown only exports one function, that takes one argument (the string of ugly markdown). Here's an example of how it can be used:\n\n```coffee\ntidyMarkdown = require 'tidy-markdown'\n\nuglyMarkdown = '''\n# Some markdown #\n\nLorem ipsum dolor adipiscing\n\n\n- one\n*  two\n+ three\n'''\n\ncleanMarkdown = tidyMarkdown(uglyMarkdown)\nconsole.log cleanMarkdown\n```\n\nwhich outputs:\n\n```markdown\n# Some markdown\n\nLorem ipsum dolor adipiscing\n\n- one\n- two\n- three\n```\n\n## Features\n\n- standardize syntactical elements to use a single way of being written (for example, all unordered lists are formatted to start with hyphens, rather than allowing asterisks and/or addition signs to be mixed in).\n- fix numbering - making ordered lists count naturally from 1 to _n_ and reference links do the same (based on first occurance).\n- make headers move from h1 to smaller without gaps (like an `h1` followed by an `h4` would be corrected to an `h1` followed by an `h2`).\n- decode Unicode characters that have markdown equivalents (like a horizontal ellipsis becomes \"...\" and an em-dash becomes \"--\").\n- format YAML front-matter and Markdown tables\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/slang800/tidy-markdown/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/slang800/tidy-markdown#readme","_id":"tidy-markdown@1.0.0","_shasum":"dfda320574e2bebab6f1e795f565cd2a87ab702e","_from":"git://github.com/slang800/tidy-markdown.git#v1.0.0","_resolved":"git://github.com/slang800/tidy-markdown.git#fc0c3f14c00685eb82fffa68f21704ddb2808e03"}
