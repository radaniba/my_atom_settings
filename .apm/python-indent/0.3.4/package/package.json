The main problem I've found is that Atom's core indentation behavior doesn't have the necessary API's yet to do what Python's [PEP8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation) suggests. Enhancement requests and issues have been opened in [Atom Core](https://github.com/atom/atom) on a few occasions, but none have been resolved yet.\n\n- language-python - [Auto indent on line continuation with list/tuple](https://github.com/atom/language-python/issues/22)\n- atom - [Autoindent not working properly](https://github.com/atom/atom/issues/6655)\n\nThis package is made to fill that gap; __python-indent__ listens for `editor:newline` events in Python source files, and when triggered, adjusts the indentation to be lined up relative to the opening delimiter of the statement _or_ \"hanging\" (for parameters, tuples, or lists). Also, when proper unindenting (back to normal) is necessary, this package assures that is done correctly.\n\n### Indent Types\nBoth indent types for continuing lines as described in [PEP 0008 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#indentation) are auto-detected and applied by this package.\n  - Aligned with Opening Delimiter\n\n    ```python\n    def function_with_lots_of_params(param_1, param_2,\n                                     param_3, param_4,\n                                     really_log_parameter_name,\n                                     param_6)\n    ```\n  - Hanging\n\n      ```python\n      def function_with_lots_of_params(\n          param_1, param_2,\n          param_3, param_4,\n          really_log_parameter_name,\n          param_6)\n      ```\n\n### Settings\n- __Aligned With Opening Delimiter Indent Regex__: Regular Expression for _aligned with opening delimiter_ continuation indent type, and used for determining when this type of indent should be _started_..\n- __Aligned With Opening Delimiter Unindent Regex__: Regular Expression for _aligned with opening delimiter_ continuation indent type, and used for determining when this type of indent should be _ended_.\n- __Hanging Indent Regex__: Regular Expression for _hanging indent_ used for determining when this type of indent should be _started_.\n- __Hanging Indent Tabs__: Number of tabs used for _hanging_ indents\n\n### Examples\n\n```python\ndef current_language_python_package(first_parameter, second_parameter,#<newline>\nthird_parameter):#<---default Atom language-python\n    pass\n\ndef with_python_indend_packgage_added(first_parameter, second_parameter,\n                                      third_parameter):\n    #<--properly unindents to here\n    pass\n\ndef with_hanging_indent(first_parameter, second_parameter,\n    third_parameter):\n    pass\n\nalso_works_with_lists = [\"apples\", \"oranges\", \"pears\", \"peaches\", \"mangoes\",\n                         \"clementies\", \"etc.\"]#<--PEP8 continued indentation\nor_like_this = [\n    \"apples\", \"oranges\", \"pears\",\n    \"peaches\", \"mangoes\", \"clementines\",\n    \"etc.\"\n]\n\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/DSpeckhals/python-indent/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/DSpeckhals/python-indent#readme","_id":"python-indent@0.3.4","_shasum":"20854190e85af1bcd946517b9da82669ab1a45f2","_resolved":"file:../d-116125-60266-chh0fk/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116125-60266-chh0fk/package.tgz"}
