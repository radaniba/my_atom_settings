Install the package (Settings > Install > search for `branch-status`)\n2. Make sure `branch-status` has a GitHub personal access token (OAuth):\n  - [Create one](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and give it **only** the\n    `repo:status` scope. See [security section](#security-section) below\n  - Add the token to the package settings (Settings > Packages > branch-status)\n\n\nIf the branch name turns pink, open the developer tools (View > Developer >\nToggle Developer Tools) and see if the console shows an error.\n\n\n### Here's what it looks like right now:\n\n![](http://cloud.patnakajima.com/image/3t422y0p2S45/Gemfile%20-%20_Users_nakajima_github_github.png)\n\n## Security\n\nIt's important to remember that inside Atom, any other package will be able to query and fetch the access token that you provide `branch-status`.\n\nYou should create a specific unique access token just for it to use. This way you can remove it later and provide it with just the access scope that it needs.\n\nYou should **ONLY** give it the `repo:status` scope.\n\n**Don't** use a general all personall access token that has full permission for this package.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nakajima/atom-branch-status/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/nakajima/atom-branch-status","_id":"branch-status@0.8.1","_shasum":"c68da41cb4433af0984696a3770b0f49ebaf0944","_resolved":"file:../d-115526-19245-ziohut/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115526-19245-ziohut/package.tgz"}
